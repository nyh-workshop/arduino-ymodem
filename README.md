# arduino-ymodem

Simple demo program of ymodem for Arduino based on [ESP32_ymodem_example by Loboris](https://github.com/loboris/ESP32_ymodem_example).

Currently this demo only receives the file from the PC and into the memory. Use an app such as Teraterm to perform the Ymodem download.

Note: Do not upload files bigger than the array declared in the main file! You can adjust the memory size based on the Arduino platform you have.
